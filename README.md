Kodikon 2.0 - Hackathon

## Problem Statement
Our college was facing issues with students not wearing id cards, So we came up with the idea of adding value to the id card by converting it as a medium of payment in college canteen. Hence we came up with this idea of idebit card.

## About
This project iDebit Card was presented in a hackathon. This project is a simulation of payment process by scanning the bar code in the id card which is an encrypted unique number for every student. And hence this unique id is used to carry all the payments.

## Achievement
The project was recognised as top 10 projects in KODIKON 2.0, a National level hackathon.
