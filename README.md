## Kodikon 2.0 - Hackathon

### Problem Statement
Our college faced issues with students not wearing ID cards. To address this, we added value to the ID card by converting it into a medium of payment for the college canteen, creating the iDebit Card.

### About
The iDebit Card project was presented at a hackathon. It simulates the payment process by scanning a barcode on the ID card, which contains an encrypted unique number for each student. This unique ID facilitates all payments, streamlining transactions within the college.

### Achievement
The iDebit Card project was recognized as one of the top 10 projects at KODIKON 2.0, a National-level hackathon.
